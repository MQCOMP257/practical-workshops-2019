# COMP257 Practicals 2019


This repository  will contain your practical notebooks for COMP257/ITEC657 2019.  The initial
repository has one notebook for the first week. Each week you will add a new notebook and commit
your changes as you complete the problems set for you.  At the end of the semester you will have
this repository as a record of your work.  This can then form part of your ongoing portfolio of work.

You can update this README file to personalise your repository.
